        In mid-2016, widespread inter-ethnic tensions and conflict descended on
        the Kasai region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), claiming
        countless lives and causing massive displacement. The Kasai crisis
        unfolded within a country already struggling with a protracted and
        underfunded emergency in the east. Since the emergence of the Kasai
        crisis, funding shortfalls proved to be a major challenge to
        WFP’sresponse.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scale of the food security and nutrition crisis in Kasai is immense.
        In September 2017, the World Food Programme (WFP)’s Emergency Food
        Security Assessment found that there were 3.2 million severely food
        insecure people in this region alone. In addition, 400,000 children are
        at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition without urgent
        life-saving assistance.
